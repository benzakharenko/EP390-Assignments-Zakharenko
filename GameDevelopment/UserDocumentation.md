# User Documentation

Welcome the user manual for "The Game Controller Drumkit," and thank you so much for downloading this instrument! This instrument is designed to be a playable drum experience in your hands, allowing you to record several layers of drums and process them with audio effects in real time.
## Before you begin:

before you begin using the "Game Controller Drumkit," please download or obtain the following materials:
* Max/MSP version 8.6
* The MaxPatch folder containing the "Game Controller Drumkit" patch itself
* the free Kilohearts effects suite (download and install the VST3 version)
* 1 PS5 controller with a USB C Cable

After downloading the patch folder and installed the Kilohearts suite, please plug your PS5 controller into your computer and boot up the patch.

## Booting up the patch:

When you first boot up the patch, you'll be met with the patch presentation screen. Please do the following steps before attempting to play the instrument to properly initialize it:

1. Adjust the tempo control to be the tempo you wish to play at. If you would like to stay at the default 120bpm, simply adjust it up or down a click or two and then restore it back to 120bpm.
2. Press every button on the game controller once (including pressing in on the touchpad and the joysticks), EXCEPT the playstation button. This initializes all the controls.
3. Load the drum samples you would like to use. There should be the default provided drum samples loaded with the patch, but if they are not there please locate them in the patch folder and drag them into the patch, matching the button labels with what control you want each sample to be played with.

## Controls

Most controls in this patch only have one function. However, some controls are accessed via a SHIFT function. These can be reached by pressing and holding the button on the bottom of the PS5 controller (aka in this patch, the SHIFT button), and then pressing the button specified.

* Left Trigger: Bitcrushing
* Right Trigger: Sample Chopping
* Left Shoulder: Crash 1
* Right Shoulder: Crash 2
* Touchpad: XY control for high-pass filter and reverb (ONLY WORKS WHEN PRESSED DOWN)
* Start: Start/Stop transport
* Back: Playing Quantization on/off
* X: Kick Drum
* Square: Snare Drum
* Triangle: Perc 1

* Circle: Perc 2
* DPad Up: High Tom (SHIFT FUNCTION: RECORD LAYER 1/CLEAR LAYER 1)
* DPad Left: Mid Tom 1 (SHIFT FUNCTION: RECORD LAYER 2/CLEAR LAYER 2)
* DPad Right: Mid Tom 2(SHIFT FUNCTION: RECORD LAYER 3/CLEAR LAYER 3)
* DPad Down: Low Tom (SHIFT FUNCTION: RECORDING LAYER 4/CLEAR LAYER 4)
* Left Joystick: Crossfading between closed hats (right), open hats (up), and rides (left). When used unpressed, they will be triggering eighth notes. When the trigger is pressed down, they will trigger sixteenth notes.
* Right Joystick: Temporarily speed up or slow down the transport. Right increases speed, left decreases speed.
* Bottom button: Shift


Note that there is no metronome on/off control from the game controller in this version, and the metronome must be turned off via a mouse click on your computer.

## Workflow

### Playing
The first step to using "The Game Controller Drumkit" is by playing your drums. To do this, start your transport and decide whether or not you would like to have the metronome playing in the background.

In this patch, there is a mode called "Playing Quantization." This automatically places your played note on the next 16th note beat, meaning every beat played will be in time. This mode is enabled by default, and the drums will only be heard when the transport is running. If you would like, you may disable this feature by pressing the "back" button.

Once the transport is running, press any of the buttons that trigger drums, or use the left joystick to create hat or ride patterns, and start creating your groove!
### Recording
Once you find a groove that you like, it is time to record. To do so, press and hold the SHIFT button on the bottom of the controller. Then, press one of the four directions on the controller dpad. Each direction represents a different layer you can record into, resulting in a total of four possible layers.

Once triggered via a dpad press, the resulting layer will start recording on the next downbeat of a bar. The recording itself will last 1 bar. Play in your pattern.

Add up to four layers of drums on top of each other. If you would like to delete a layer, simply record into that layer again, but play nothing for a bar--the layer will then record silence, which can later be overwritten by any other pattern you want.
### Effects
After recording your pattern, it's time to have fun with it in real time! Use the left and right triggers to mess around with fun bitcrushing or sample chopping effects. Press on the touchpad and move your finger around to control a high pass filter and reverb effect. Move the right joystick left or right to slow down or speed up the tempo temporarily, adjusting the pitch of the layers with it.

Please note that these controls can all also be used while playing as well, if you have enough hand dexterity for it :)
